/**
 * AppSettings — the singleton application-config record.
 *
 * A `Document` (plain MongoDB row, NOT Stuff) holding a single open
 * key/value bag of application-wide, operator-managed settings. The fourth
 * config category beyond per-player `settings` (`EnvironmentMixin`),
 * per-Stuff `Propertied`, and client-UI-state; distinct from infra/secrets
 * (`.env` / Parameter Store).
 *
 * The persisted state is a SINGLE generic `values` bag, never a field per
 * setting — `persistentFields = ['values']` never grows; adding a setting
 * is a YAML entry (`mud/config/app-settings.yaml`) plus a consumer.
 *
 * **The values live in the DB, seeded from YAML — there are no code-side
 * defaults.** `AppSettingsSeeder` (a backend seeder, like EmoteSeeder)
 * populates the row from `app-settings.yaml`; this Document is pure
 * persistence + an in-memory cache. `warm()` loads the seeded row into the
 * cache at boot so the synchronous read surface (`AppApi`) never awaits.
